## My process

I tried working from the outward to inward, putting layer on layer. After all was on the screen and its general place I started doing more fine positioning and styling.

### Built with

HTML&CSS.

### What I learned

I'm fairly new these kind of projects, this is only my third ever, and I'n completely self-taught. So pretty much everything I do is learning new things.
Saying that I think the moat considerable topic I learned with this project is how to adjust different elements is the body to alternative screen widths.

### Continued development

After This challenge I'll do another one and another one until I'm confident in my HTML&CSS skill. when this is done I'll continue to practice bootstrap features.
